This is set of notebooks for doing power calculations based on simulated 
student success as a repeated binary outcome.

Power calculations used the following steps:

1. Definition of a generic exponential  learning curve model based on definition of:
    1. Baseline success rate
    1. Final success rate
    1. Number of attempts to improve half way
1. Four separate populations of students were randomly generated by specifying:
    1. alpha and beta parameters a beta distribution
    1. a maximal proportion of failure risk to discount which is discounted by a uniformly random (0-1) number
    1. the Rayleigh distribution parameter for the number of attempts to improve halfway
1. For each student population a series of student groups were randomly drawn then a set of random attempts were simulated in groups. Each group had their predicted failure rate discounted by a fixed proportion to represent different effects.
1. From the simulated groups different outcomes were assessed using "Generalized Estimating Equations" using trials of different pairs of groups and increasing sample sizes. Each comparison was the classified as:
    1. wrong (p < 0.05 and wrong conclusion reached)
    1. ns (p >= 0.05)
    1. sig (0.05 > p > 0.01)
    1. vsig (p <= 0.01)
1. The simulated studies were then filtered to find the smallest study where at least 80% reached a significance of p < 0.05.
